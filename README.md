The directory 'DataSetsPreprocessing' contains files in their orginal format that are downloaded and processed by the Notebooks if the files are not directly downloaded from the public internet into the Notebooks for various reasons.
The directory 'DataSetsModels' contains all pre-processed files and is used by the 'Model Creation' Notebook.
Addtionally in this Repo there is a Python Script for Hyper Parameter Tuning on a local machine.
